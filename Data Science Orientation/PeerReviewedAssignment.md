# Understanding the Impact of Data Science in the Modern World

## Introduce yourself and share with your peers your background and any experience you have with data science. (1 mark)

I am a prospective freshman at the University of Delhi and will be joining an undergraduate degree program in Mathematics and Physics and/or Electronics. I had completed the final year of my schooling in 2018 and majored in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics. I took a gap year to learn the 'trending' skills required in any industry in general. I learnt Web Development and did some freelancing in this time frame. I am taking a course on Machine Learning too. I have earlier derived conclusions from experiments and surveys using statistical methods for high school projects, exhibits for science fairs and my thesis. However, I do not have any 'professional' experience in the field of data science wherein the term 'professional' I am referring to means working on a project employing data science at a startup or a company.

## Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science? (3 marks)

I would define a data scientist as an curious, judgemental and argumentative individual that can derive valuable, meaningful, and sometimes, hidden insights and analytics from a given pool of data (structured or otherwise). A data scientist is expected to have sound knowledge of statistics, mathematics and probability theory, decent programming knowledge (or computational thinking) to use the necessary tools along with excellent presentation (storytelling) skills to communicate their findings.

Data Science can be defined as a field wherein we use data to analyse its behaviour (data analysis), study its properties, manipulate it using mathematical algorithms (such as applying machine learning models like regression) and visualise it using an appropriate method to come up with viable results and recommendations that speak for themselves. It also deals with the problem of storing data in case of large datasets.

## As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. What industry are you passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in? (1 mark)

Out of the massive global pool of industries, I am passionate about Electronics, Communication Systems and the Biomedical industries partly due to my technical exposure and interest in the mentioned fields. I am particularly strong and informed of the applications in the Electronics field as I have made use of microprocessors and SBCs and have had experience capturing massive datasets while tinkering with them. Data Science has the capability to increase the quality and efficiency of the production process (for instance, utilising data from oscilloscopes and quality detection sensors) as well as marketing the product. I wish to pursue a data science career in the mentioned field (even a related one would do the job just as well).

## Based on the videos and the reading material, what are the ten main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project? (5 marks)

The ten main components of a report that is to be delivered at the end of a data science project are as follows:

  - **Cover Page**: It should include the title of the report, names of the authors, their affiliations and contacts, name of the publisher (if any), and the date of publication. It is also recommended to include contact information on the cover page.
  - **Table of Contents**: It enlists the main headings of the report (and may even contain a list of tables and figures) and helps the reader navigate around the entire document.
  - **Abstract or Executive Summary**: A short summary of the report helps the reader grasp the crux of the report and can be extremely instrumental in a corporate scenario.
  - **Introduction and Literature Review**: The Introduction helps to set up the reader for the topic that the project deals with and introduce the reader to the subject matter. Research questions and hypotheses are introduced in the Literature Review.
  - **Methodology**: It discusses the research methods employed and data sources used for the study.
  - **Results and Discussion**: Empirical findings are discussed in the Results section and can also make use of illustrative graphics and plots to summarize the findings. The Discussion section is used for crafting the main argument of the report and highlighting how the results provide the answers to the research questions.
  - **Conclusion**: In this section, specific findings are generalised and to promote the findings over any possible caveats outlined earlier. Future possible developments and applications that can result from the research can also be discussed in this section.
